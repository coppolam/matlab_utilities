# matlab_utilities

This repository contains several general Matlab utilities and functions that are deemed applicable to a wide range of projects.

If you plan to contribute, the general rules for development:

* Editing of existing functions to make them better (no bugs/faster/more robust) is highly encouraged. 
* However, try to not change inputs/outputs of functions as other people using such functions may be confused in the future when their code doesn't work.
* Functions should be as general and robust as possible
* Comments are highly welcome
